# GoverLan2Zendesk
Goverlan to Zendesk application

Application created in vb.net to allow techs to 
<li>select enduser email information</li>
<li>open up Goverlan</li>
<li>then create a ticket on Zendesk ticketing system</li>
Since Goverlan does not have any APIs I will try to create work arounds to pass data between app and Goverlan
